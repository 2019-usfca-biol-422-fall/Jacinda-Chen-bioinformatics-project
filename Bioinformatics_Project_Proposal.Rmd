#Overview of Proposed Project

The project I am planning will look at the microbiome of two species of native plants on the USF campus. I will sample them from the Lone Mountain steps area, taking one leaf from each of three plants from two different species.

In more detail, I plan to look at species of *Mimulus*, also known as monkeyflower. These are native to California and exist on the USF campus.

Microbiomes on University Campuses are a subject of some recent research [@ross2015microbial].
