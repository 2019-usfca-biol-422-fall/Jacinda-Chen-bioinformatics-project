# Overview of Proposed Project

Computers have become an essential part of college life as a result of the increased need of the internet. Food and drinks are constantly consumed around keyboards, which might provide food for whatever is living on top of the keyboard, if there is [@malik2014study]. Therefore, more and more students are required to buy or have access to computers. The keyboard is touched constantly in personal laptops as well as shared computers that the university offers and most people are not aware of the number of microorganisms present on their keyboards [@al2011bacterial]. I will be comparing the bacteria found on the keyboards of individual students' laptops versus the keyboards of shared computers on the USF campus.  Previous research done on this topic has found that shared computers had more microorganisms than individual computers [@anderson2009microbial]. This project will cirlce around hygeine and aim to figure out if shared computers should be cleaned more often or if personal laptops are not as sanitary as they seem.  

## Question

My question is whether or not the keyboards of individual USF college students have more or less microbacterial species compared to shared computers on campus. My hypothesis is that the keyboards of shared computers have more microbacterial species than individual keyboards because of the increased number of people that have access to the keyboard. 

## Study Design

The project I am planning will look at the number of bacteria on laptop keyboards of USF students versus the bacteria found on the inside of a toilet. I will sample  different keyboards of three different laptops each used by individual USF students as well as the keyboards of three different shared computers on the main campus of USF. 

In further detail, I will be sampling the letter "A" on the keyboard of Apple laptops for individual users and the keyboard of shared computers on campus.
